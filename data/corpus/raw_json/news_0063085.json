So long as the money had not been withdrawn at the other end, cash could be frozen after a subscriber informed them of an erroneous transaction. Then after some checks it could be returned.\nIf the wrong recipient had already withdrawn the money, then “the customer would be advised to negotiate with the person [wrong recipient],” said MTN spokeswoman Justina Ntabgoba.\nUganda Communications Commission (UCC) executive director Godfrey Mutabazi said he was setting up an investigation.\n“MTN is in the process of renewing their license and we want these matters to be sorted before we do that,” he told Reuters.\nMTN Uganda’s 20-year licence, secured in 1998, expires in October.\nAccording to the regulator, nearly all of Uganda’s 24 million mobile subscribers also have a mobile money account.\nThe firm is Uganda’s biggest telecom concern, followed by India’s Bharti Airtel.\nThe Twitter criticism was set off on Sunday by a university lecturer who tweeted that he had made a mistake while trying to send money to a friend for funeral expenses.\nWhen he called the company and asked for the transaction to be reversed, he was told he needed a court order to claim the money from the recipient.
