In a media briefing early Thursday at GM headquarters in Detroit, President Dan Ammann said the investment by SoftBank's $100-billion Vision Fund will enable GM to deploy self-driving vehicles \"at massive scale.\"\nChief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the company is still \"on track\" to begin deploying its Cruise AVs in commercial ride sharing fleets in 2019.\nGM will also invest $1.1 billion in the unit after the deal closes, the company said.\nSoftBank Vision Fund will own a 19.6 percent stake in GM Cruise once the transaction is completed.\nThe partners agreed not to cash out their investments in Cruise for at least seven years, said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank Investment Advisers.\nBarra sidestepped a question about whether GM intends to spin off GM Cruise Holdings as a separate entity, saying GM would \"do what's best for shareholders.\"\nRonen soft-pedaled a related question about whether SoftBank intends to consolidate its massive investments in some of the world's largest ride services companies, including Uber, Didi, Ola and Grab, saying such a decision would be up to each company.\nGM holds a sizable stake in Uber rival Lyft.\nThe SoftBank investment comes at a time when rivals Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit and Uber Technologies Inc are stepping up efforts to gain the first-mover advantage in the autonomous vehicle market.\nGM Cruise Holdings was set up recently and its assets include Cruise Automation, which heads up GM's self-driving vehicle development and is based in San Francisco, and Strobe, a small self-driving sensor developer that Cruise acquired last year.\nThe No. 1 U.S. automaker - which views electric and autonomous vehicles as the keystones of future transport - has focused on rolling out self-driving cars since its estimated $1 billion acquisition of Cruise Automation in early 2016.
