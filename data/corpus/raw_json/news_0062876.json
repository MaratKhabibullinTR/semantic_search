GfK’s major purchase index slipped by two points in May to 1.\n“Shoppers are still not showing signs of a willingness to splash-the-cash,” Staton said.\nLloyds Bank’s index of business confidence was up by three points at 35 percent in May, its highest level of 2018.\nThe survey also showed the proportion of firms expecting Brexit to help their business rose to its highest level this year at 35 percent while 28 percent expected a negative impact.\n“Business confidence is rising and firms appear to be brushing off the economic slowdown in the first quarter,” Hann-Ju Ho, Senior Economist, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.\nAnother survey of small and medium-sized manufacturers showed 53 percent of respondents intended to hire more staff over the next six months, up five percentage points from three months ago and the highest level in over two years.\nBut companies were a bit more reluctant to invest with 48 percent planning to spend on new machinery and premises, according to the survey of almost 300 firms conducted by South West Manufacturing Advisory Service, a consultancy.
