During the first half of calendar year 2018, we are focusing on consolidating the past acquisitions and developing the current product portfolio. We have 3 commercially launched products (Recolor, Incolour and MyHospital) with an additional 3 products under development and expected to be launched within calendar year 2018. Recolor continues to be our flagship product and at the center of efforts with geographical expansion, brand partnerships and Android version together with new core product improvements as key success drivers. Recolor product development was transferred to Zagreb during January to March 2018 to enable tripling the size of the development team and supporting a global suite of coloring products. This transfer caused a short-term delay in implementation of our growth drivers but the investments are expected to produce results already in the second half of calendar year 2018. I would like to thank all our employees and partners for outstanding work and our shareholders for patience during the first half of 2018 when we will create the foundation for future growth.”\nAbout Kuuhubb\nKuuhubb is a company active in the digital space that focuses mainly on lifestyle and mobile video game applications.
