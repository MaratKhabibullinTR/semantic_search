Previously, Mr. Elahi was a founding partner of Life Sciences Group, Inc., a diagnostic imaging provider, and spent four years at Ponder & Co. where he co-established the firm’s healthcare merger and acquisition (M&A) practice.\nMr. Elahi also spent six years as an M&A banker, initially with Citicorp and Salomon Smith Barney in New York where he focused on the utilities and energy industries, and later with ABN AMRO in Chicago where his primary role was M&A transaction management in the healthcare industry.\n“Dresner's tradition of providing comprehensive investment banking and specialized advisory services to the healthcare services and product sectors is unique in the industry, and this is my primary reason for returning to the firm,” said Mr. Elahi. “We are focused on long-term relationships with health systems, post-acute and alternate-site providers, and product manufacturers and payers that are founded on providing solutions across a broad spectrum of client needs. Additionally, our deep understanding of the evolving structure of the industry and its interrelationships, particularly as manifested in recent unconventional M&A activity, allows us view each assignment from an uncommonly unique perspective.”\n“We are very pleased to have Ejaz Elahi rejoin the firm. His return is true testament to the lasting relationships Dresner strives to foster with its employees and clients,” said Steven M. Dresner, President of Dresner Partners and Vice Chairman of IMAP. “Ejaz’s extensive industry knowledge and transaction experience will help maximize the value our talented investment banking team provides to our clients.”\nMr. Elahi has participated in over 60 M&A transactions, including the $1.1 billion sale of the 14-hospital Health Midwest system to HCA. Other notable transactions Mr. Elahi completed while at Dresner included the restructuring and subsequent sale of Medical Resources, Inc. (a 60-site outpatient diagnostic imaging provider) to 10 separate buyers, and a series of non-core asset sales for the Carle Foundation (a large community hospital system). He also has experience in other highly regulated industry sectors including electric utilities and telecommunications.\nMr. Elahi holds an MBA from the University of Chicago, a Master of Science in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\nAbout Dresner Partners / IMAP\nDresner Partners is a FINRA-registered, middle-market investment bank headquartered in Chicago, with offices in New York City, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Irvine and Palo Alto, Calif.
