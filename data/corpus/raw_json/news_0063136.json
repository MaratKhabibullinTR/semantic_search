That would suggest about 70 billion yen ($644.5 million) based on its latest disclosure, which puts its holdings of foreign bonds at around 7 trillion yen.\n“We thought Italian political risks were underestimated when the two-year Italian yield was so close to the German yields ahead of the election,” Tachibana said.\nThe two-year Italian debt yield was around minus 0.10-0.20 percent, compared to minus 0.60 percent, just before the inconclusive election.\nIt spiked to almost 3 percent on Tuesday, marking the biggest one-day rise since 1992, after the two anti-establishment parties clashed with the country’s president who rejected their choice of an eurosceptic economist as finance minister.\nTachibana said Japan Post sought to buy some Italian bonds on Wednesday only to be hindered by wide bid-offer spreads.\n“The market seemed to be overreacting. I don’t think Italy would default on its debts.”\nKampo is the insurance arm of formerly state-owned conglomerate Japan Post Holdings and has been increasing investments in riskier assets since it was partially privatized in 2015.\nIn the last financial year, it was one of the most aggressive buyers of foreign bonds among Japanese insurers, boosting its holdings by 1 trillion yen.\nJapan’s largest private insurer Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, said on Wednesday it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings.\nSince the middle of last year, many Japanese investors have been piling into European bonds because their yields after currency hedging are attractive.\nFrom October to March, Japanese investors bought 1.57 trillion yen of German bonds, 2.09 trillion yen of French bonds, 695 billion yen of Spanish bonds and 266 billion yen of Irish bonds.\nBut Japanese investors have taken a cautious stance on Italian bonds in the past half year, buying only 52 billion yen.\n($1 = 108.62 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:23:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
