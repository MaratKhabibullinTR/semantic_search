Lawmakers finally enacted a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Rauner’s vetoes last July.\nRevenue from the tax increase, which Rauner has vowed to roll back, is incorporated in the budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.\nNot all lawmakers were sold on the bipartisan plan. Republican State Representative David McSweeney said the budget should be rejected because it fails to cut spending and reduce taxes.\n“The taxpayers of this state are getting killed and this bill continues the carnage,” he said during the debate.\nThe spending plan does not include controversial elements in Rauner’s proposed budget, which called for shifting some pension costs currently paid by the state onto local school districts, state universities and community colleges.\nThe budget adds $350 million to a new K-12 school funding formula enacted last year, increases higher education spending by 2 percent, reduces cuts in state aid to local governments, and appropriates $1.3 billion to pay previously incurred expenses.\nIt also includes a voluntary buyout of certain pension benefits expected to save the state about $423 million in fiscal 2019.
