The offer was above an Iberdrola bid of 32.10 a share which it made through its Brazilian subsidiary Neoenergia.\nA source close to the matter said bids on Wednesday were due in by 7 p.m. (2300 GMT) and would be opened after.\nThe auction on June 4 was effectively the settlement date after Eletropaulo investors had decided what to do with their shares in the light of the bids, the source said.\nThe Enel bid is dependent on 50 percent of Eletropaulo shareholders plus one accepting the offer.\nOn Tuesday the board of Eletropaulo recommended its shareholders accept Enel’s bid because it was higher but added it was open to modifying its opinion if bids changed.
