Kenya’s government is expected to take a stake through state-owned National Oil.\nA government official told Reuters last month that Wood was picked to design the pipeline.\nTullow has said the Amosing and Ngamia fields in the basin have estimated contingent resources of about 560 million barrels, with plateau production potentially reaching 100,000 barrels per day.\nThe cost of the pipeline is estimated at $1.1 billion, with a further $2.9 billion needed for upstream operations, Tullow says. A final investment decision on the upstream and pipeline plans is expected in 2019.\nTullow picked Australia’s Worley Parsons as engineers for its oil blocks, a government official said.\nKenya moved a closer to full production at the blocs this month when the local government and the national government agreed on revenue sharing.\nThe agreement on revenue sharing will pave the way for the passage of a much delayed law on petroleum production, allowing Tullow to start shipping oil, which has been held in storage tanks for a year as it waited for the law.\nReporting By Shadia Nasralla; Additional reporting by Duncan Miriri in Nairobi; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:14:42.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
