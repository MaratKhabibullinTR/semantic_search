Those involved also witnessed the inauguration of the GSMA\nFoundry project: Mobile Network for Thriving AI, signifying that operators are\nentering experience monetization and are beginning experience-centered network\nconstruction for mobile AI.\n\nMobile AI Ecosystem Synergy for a Thriving Mobile AI Industry\n\nSpeaking at the summit, Wen Ku, President of China Communications Standards\nAssociation (CCSA), highlighted: \"The integration of 5G-A and AI is one of the\nkey directions for communications network evolution. Efforts should focus on\nsetting standards, building smart network integration, and fostering\ncollaborative development through ecosystems to pioneer the future of mobile\nAI.\"\n\nDuring the summit, industry pioneers from Rokid, MiniMax, and Unitree Robotics\ndiscussed how AI service providers can take the lead in terms of\ndifferentiated competition, and quickly seize new market opportunities. AI\nagents are expanding experiences from touchscreen interactions to multi-modal\ninteractions such as voice, video, and spatial computing. Furthermore, AI is\nachieving higher audio-visual bit rates and model accuracy, and utilizing 5G-A\nnetworks to reduce latency during interactions for more efficient service\nprovisioning. This is vital for providing seamless new services, such as those\ninvolving real-time interactions and high-quality AI video calling, which\nrequire an uplink speed of at least 20 Mbps.\n\nA number of speakers, including Zhi-Quan Luo, a Foreign Member of the Chinese\nAcademy of Engineering and Fellow of IEEE, operator representatives, and\nrepresentatives from Ookla also shared their AI practices in network\noptimization, as well as their strategic planning for comprehensively\nembracing AI technologies. AI is reshaping both mobile networks and the wider\nmobile industry. This is helping operators achieve the digital transformation\nof networks, O&M, and businesses to provide differentiated services for\nvarious industries, thus supporting their transition from traffic monetization\nto business monetization. At the summit, the participants reached the\nconsensus that uplink, latency, and stability are the most crucial factors in\nmeasuring network capabilities for mobile AI.\n\nGigaBand Powers the Evolution of Foundation Network Monetization from Mobile\nBroadband (MBB) to Mobile AI\n\nAs a leading 5G-A technology provider, Huawei has shared its GigaBand solution\nportfolio. Through the implementation of air interface resource (AIR) pooling\nand optimization solver (Optsolver) for AIR orchestration, GigaBand enables\nsmooth 5G-A network evolution to support new AI services. This is helping\noperators build elastic networks that feature SLA assurance and are adapted to\ndiversified and differentiated services like live streaming, mobile AI\nassistants, and cloud gaming. For example, the deployment of GigaBand in Hong\nKong has enabled multi-band 4G/5G sharing for different service provisioning\nintents, achieving an up to 2.28-fold increase in 5G throughputs while\nmaintaining stable 4G user experience. This has been a huge boon for operators\nas they look to build efficient, smart, and low-carbon 5G SA networks.\n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720602/Industry_education_research_business_representatives_Mobile_AI_Summit.html)\n\nWith 5G-A continuing to be upgraded with GigaBand and other innovative\ntechnologies, alongside collaborative ecosystem innovation across industries,\nmobile AI is developing into a new engine propelling the revenue growth of the\nmobile industry and bringing people a new digital life featuring ubiquitous\nintelligent services.\n\nMWC Shanghai 2025 was held from June 18 to June 20 in Shanghai, China. During\nthe event, Huawei showcased its latest products and solutions in Hall N1 of\nthe Shanghai New International Expo Center (SNIEC).\n\nThe commercial adoption of 5G-Advanced is accelerating in 2025. Huawei\ncollaborates with global carriers, industry experts, and opinion leaders to\nexplore how innovations in AI can be used to reshape telecom services,\ninfrastructure, and operations to generate new revenue sources and accelerate\nthe transition towards an intelligent world.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://carrier.huawei.com/en/events/mwcs2025\n(https://carrier.huawei.com/en/events/mwcs2025)\n\nView original content to download\nmultimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huawei-and-industry-partners-reach-consensus-on-mobile-ai-foundation-networks-driving-5g-a-experience-monetization-302493089.html\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huawei-and-industry-partners-reach-consensus-on-mobile-ai-foundation-networks-driving-5g-a-experience-monetization-302493089.html)\n\nSOURCE Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd\n\n\n\nyangmingxi1@huawei.com\n\nPhoto: \nhttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720602/Industry_education_research_business_representatives_Mobile_AI_Summit.jpg\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

At college level,\ntutors said the same for at least 43% of 16–18-year-olds. The top three\nfactors teachers and tutors identified as impacting readiness were:\n\n * Primary – Special Educational Needs and/or Disabilities (79%), struggles\nwith writing (75%) and independence (73%)\n * Secondary – self-motivation (77%), independence (65%) and social maturity\n(62%)\n * College – digital wellbeing (30%), critical thinking (30%), and struggles\nwith writing (28%)\nAlso adding their perspectives to the annual report's biggest-ever dataset\nwere 3,000 UK students across primary, secondary and college settings. Despite\ndemonstrating a clear enjoyment of learning, nearly 1 in 5 school students\n(17%) and 1 in 4 of college students (26%) are concerned about being ready for\nthe next stage of learning.\n\nTo support improved learning and outcomes, those surveyed offered practical\nideas and solutions. Their suggestions highlight a clear desire for more\nflexible, student-centred approaches, that include:\n\n * Stronger connections to everyday life. One in three school students would\nintegrate lessons about things in everyday life. 40% said managing money and\nbudgeting skills are currently missing from their education, alongside\nspeaking confidently in front of others (33%), support with how to get a job\nand workplace/interview skills (29%), as well as communication skills (26%).\n \n * Enhanced focus on practical skills. Over a third of secondary students (37%)\nwant to be taught creative skills (35% of teachers agree), 30% of secondary\nstudents and 16% of teachers want a greater focus on digital skills.\n \n * Adapting to AI advances. 44% of secondary teachers and 31% of primary teachers\nsay they don't think students are being well prepared for an AI-driven world.\nThis is echoed by secondary and college students with more than 1 in 4\nbelieving they should learn about AI at school/college to improve skills.\nHowever, only 9% of teachers currently feel confident teaching students how to\nuse AI, with calls for greater training for both existing and trainee\nteachers.\n \n * Clearer links between learning and career paths. Only 8% of teachers feel the\neducation system prepares students for future careers. Students share this\nconcern. 15% of primary students are worried about getting a job in the\nfuture, doubling to 31% at secondary and 37% at college.\n \n * Prioritising student outcomes: Self-confidence and awareness (54%), a love of\nlearning (50%), life skills (40%) and an understanding of the wider world\n(40%) feature highly in teachers priority outcomes for students. Across the\nphases, problem solving, critical thinking, resilience and confidence are\nconsistent qualities that teachers, tutors and home educators think students\nshould develop outside of academic ability.\n \n * A reduction in curriculum volume and less emphasis on final exams: A fifth of\ncollege students (20%) say the volume of curriculum and assessment impacts\ntheir learning. 58% of school teachers would also like to see this addressed.\nReducing the focus on final exams was also key with 34% of school teachers\nsaying modular assessments would improve outcomes, while 58% of college tutors\nsaid the same for more flexible options like 'banking' credit over time. This\nwas also the most favoured option to improve learning and assessment for\nsecondary school students.\nSpeaking about the findings, Freya Thomas Monk, Managing Director of Pearson\nQualifications, said: \"Over 14,000 students, teachers, tutors and home\neducators have spoken, and we have a real opportunity to listen and act.\nHundreds of thousands of young people are facing barriers across every stage\nof education, impacting their potential and progression both now and in the\nfuture.\n\n\"Our world is constantly evolving and learning needs to do the same. We can\nbetter prepare students for their next step through more engaging and relevant\ncurricula, flexible assessments that work for all students, and the thoughtful\nuse of technology to put choice, personalisation and accessibility front and\ncentre. By doing this we equip them for learning pathways that lead to\nopportunity, growth, and a confident future.\"\n\nJason Elsom, Chief Executive of Parentkind, the UK's largest parent charity,\nsaid: \"We need to get children ready for the middle of the twenty-first\ncentury. A child starting school this year will enter the workplace in the\nlate 2030s and reach the age of 30 in the year 2050 when life and work will be\nvery different.\n\n\"Robotics, artificial intelligence, and rapid advances in science and medicine\nwill without a doubt change the way we will live and work and threaten not\njust low-wage and low-skilled jobs but roles at every level, and of every\ndegree of knowledge and skill. It is more important than ever that today's\nchildren become lifelong learners, not switched off from learning.\"\n\nTo explore this year's full findings, download Pearson School Report 2025:\nLearning for Life here\n(https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4458088-1&h=1207137801&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearson.com%2Fen-gb%2Fschools%2Finsights-and-events%2Ftopics%2Fschool-report.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeneral%26utm_medium%3Dpress-release%26utm_campaign%3DGBEDGN0425SCHR&a=here)\n from Friday 27 June.\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAbout the research\nPearson commissioned a nationally representative external survey of primary\nand secondary classroom teachers, middle leaders, school leaders and\nheadteachers working in schools in England between 29 March 2025 and 25 April\n2025. Between 2,355 and 9,821 responded to the questions. Responses were\ncollected by the polling organisation Teacher Tapp and weighted to reflect\nnational teacher and school demographics.\n\nResearch was also conducted by Censuswide in April 2025 with 1,000 primary\nschool students (aged 7–11 years), 1,000 secondary school students (aged\n11–16 years), 1,000 college students, 1,000 college tutors and 75 parents\nwho are home/flexi-schooling their children. Censuswide abides by and employs\nmembers of the Market Research Society and follows the MRS code of conduct and\nESOMAR principles. Censuswide is also a member of the British Polling\nCouncil.\n\nAbout Pearson\nAt Pearson, our purpose is simple: to help people realise the life they\nimagine through learning.

The company's exhibition at this\nyear's event has been titled \"Accelerating the Intelligent World\" as they\nintend to meet with global carriers, industry partners, and opinion leaders to\ndiscuss new paths for carrier development that focus on creating value using\nAI.\n\nHuawei's showcase is focusing on their latest innovations in three areas:\n\n * Services: Huawei is expected to announce the success of a number of 5G-A\nexperience monetization and scenario-based AI application (AItoX) projects\nthey have carried out in collaboration with China's three major carriers.\n * Infrastructure: Huawei is hosting presentations by their carrier partners on\ntheir recent experience in building AI-centric networks. The company also\nlaunches a new comprehensive AI Ultra-Broadband (AI UBB) solution that covers\nall network layers from home broadband to transport networks. The solution\ncomes with end-to-end built-in computing power and comprehensive performance\nenhancements aimed at accelerating network evolution towards higher-level\nautonomy, which will in turn improve AI application experience and enable\nbusiness growth.\n * Operations: Huawei and China's three major carriers jointly share their latest\nbest achievements in intelligent wireless network operations and intelligent\nhome broadband operations.\nCommercial 5G-A adoption is expected to accelerate in a number of regions in\n2025, including China, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Carriers in these\nregions are actively exploring experience monetization models.\n\nEric Xu, Huawei's Deputy Chairman and Rotating Chairman, gave a keynote on\npathways for driving growth in the telecoms industry. Xu began his speech by\nsharing observations about the current status of the telecoms industry: \"After\nnearly four decades of rapid growth, the industry has entered a period of\nsteady development, while facing some challenges to new growth.\"\n\nHe proceeded to expand on four potential pathways to growth:\n\n * Ramping up for changes in user needs and meeting new demands with high growth\npotential\n * Boosting HD video supply and consumption through coordinated efforts across\nthe ecosystem\n * Bringing 5G to every car for new growth in intelligent connected vehicles\n * Bringing FTTR to micro and small businesses to make the most of opportunities\nin AI\n\"Of course, every carrier is different,\" concluded Xu. \"Their markets are\ndifferent, their business environment is different – and so is their\ncompetitive landscape. So the pathways to growth are different, too. We're\nready and willing to work together, helping carriers explore opportunities\nunique to them and carve out the right pathways to long-term, sustainable\ngrowth.\"\n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720600/Huawei_s_booths_Hall_N1_MWC_Shanghai_2025.html)\n\nChina has emerged as a global pioneer in 5G-A, with 5G-A already available in\nover 300 of its cities. Carriers now offer 5G-A mobile plans in more than 30\nChinese provinces and the country currently has over 10 million 5G-A users.\nCarriers in China, the Middle East, and other regions are also exploring the\nnew value framework for experience monetization by introducing premium upgrade\ninitiatives. 5G-A offers users ultra-fast networks and fuels intelligent\ntransformation in multiple sectors, including smart living, transportation,\nand manufacturing.\n\nThe communications industry is facing significant disruption thanks to\nAI-driven innovation. The success of new experience monetization models also\nindicates the industry will soon enter a new era of growth.\n\nCarriers are uniquely positioned to embrace this surge in AI and explore new\nAI applications because of their inherent strengths in cloud, network,\nintelligence, and computing. They are using AI to transform their services,\ninfrastructure, and operations, which is unlocking new drivers for business\ngrowth.\n\nMany carriers are rebranding themselves as providers of personalized and\nintegrated, AI agents that are accessible to consumers. Within the smart home\nmarket, they are upgrading existing services by enabling coordination between\nvarious smart devices to enhance smart home companionship. Carriers are also\nmoving into the in-vehicle services market by integrating AI agents with\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies to create smart, mobile third spaces.\nFor businesses, they are upgrading their capabilities by enhancing\ncomputing-network services and model-based services to empower operations.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://carrier.huawei.com/en/events/mwcs2025\n(https://carrier.huawei.com/en/events/mwcs2025)\n\nView original content to download\nmultimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/5g-a-users-reach-10-million-in-china-huawei-showcases-5g-a-development-and-value-of-scenario-based-ai-302493091.html\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/5g-a-users-reach-10-million-in-china-huawei-showcases-5g-a-development-and-value-of-scenario-based-ai-302493091.html)\n\nSOURCE Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd\n\n\n\nyangmingxi1@huawei.com\n\nPhoto: \nhttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720600/Huawei_s_booths_Hall_N1_MWC_Shanghai_2025.jpg\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

Founded on\nDecember 1, 1914, this iconic Roman restaurant is world-renowned for its\nfamous Fettuccine all'Alfredo, a dish that has captured palates and hearts far\nbeyond Italian borders.\n\nThe secret to these fettuccine, an authentic alchemy of flavors, lies in the\nmantecatura, an ancient art that owner Mario Mozzetti, the current\n\"Mantecatore,\" masters and passionately protects. As Mozzetti explains, \"Three\ningredients, but of the highest quality: Fettuccine, butter, Parmigiano\nReggiano, and the hands of the mantecatore.\" This technique, which involves\n\"creaming\" the fettuccine in front of the customer, has made the dish a main\nattraction and a sought-after destination for Romans and international\ntourists alike.\n\n \n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720686/Mario_Mozzetti_Alfredo_alla_Scrofa.html)\n\n \n\nThe global fame of Fettuccine Alfredo took off in the 1920s, when Hollywood\nstars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, on their honeymoon in Rome, fell in\nlove with the dish. Upon their return to the United States, they sent Alfredo\ndi Lelio, the founder, solid gold utensils—a fork and a spoon—engraved\nwith their names and a special dedication.\n\nDespite its export, as Mozzetti points out, \"Fettuccine Alfredo 'sailed across\nthe ocean,' but they were poorly exported,\" eventually becoming \"a 'trashy'\ndish in the collective imagination\" over time due to incorrect versions. The\nMozzetti family, who acquired the restaurant from Alfredo in 1943, is now\ncommitted to restoring the excellence of this iconic dish, with Mario Mozzetti\ndescribing himself as a \"pianist\" capable of making the fettuccine \"dance\"\nwith a technical and passionate gesture.\n\nAlfredo alla Scrofa was the first restaurant in the Capital to be included in\nthe Register of \"historic\" businesses by the Rome Chamber of Commerce,\ntestifying to its value and tradition. Mario Mozzetti's current challenge is\nto combine history with novelty, tradition with the future, and to reinterpret\nthe past in a contemporary key. Recent initiatives include the inauguration of\nthe restaurant's ancient cellars, now boasting a selection of over 500 labels,\nand the upcoming opening of an Academy dedicated to the art of mantecatura,\nwhich will be located right next to the historic restaurant.\n\nThis continuous commitment to preserving heritage and fostering innovation\nensures that Alfredo alla Scrofa will remain a landmark in Roman gastronomy.\n\nPhoto:\nhttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720686/Mario_Mozzetti_Alfredo_alla_Scrofa.jpg\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720686/Mario_Mozzetti_Alfredo_alla_Scrofa.jpg)\n\nPress Office:\nIlaria Melillo\nAdnkronos Comunicazione\n+39 065807262\n\nView original content to download\nmultimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alfredo-alla-scrofa-111-years-of-history-for-a-roman-culinary-institution-302493131.html\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alfredo-alla-scrofa-111-years-of-history-for-a-roman-culinary-institution-302493131.html)\n\nSOURCE Alfredo alla Scrofa\n\n\n\nPhoto: \nhttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720686/Mario_Mozzetti_Alfredo_alla_Scrofa.jpg\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

He led the Flying Tigers – formally known as the American Volunteer\nGroup – in support of China's war against Japanese aggression.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, Flying Tiger squadrons flew supplies over the treacherous\n\"Hump Route\" across the Himalayas, delivering more than 800,000 tons of\nmaterial – nearly the only allied supply line into China. In combat, they\nshot down over 2,600 Japanese aircraft, sank or damaged 44 enemy ships, and\nsuffered heavy losses: 2,193 American pilots died in action, and over 200 were\nrescued by local Chinese civilians.\n\n\"Chinese and American heroes defended peace and justice with their blood and\nlives,\" Sha Hailin, President of the Shanghai Public Relations Association and\nDirector of the Academic Committee of Shanghai Institute of American Studies,\nsaid at a conference in Shanghai on June 23, as he recalled the wartime\nalliance between the Chinese and American peoples.\n\nThe conference was part of a series of events in Shanghai that day,\ncommemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War\nof Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.\nThemed History Illuminates the Present, Cooperation Lights the Future, the\nevents were jointly hosted by the Shanghai Public Relations Association and\nShanghai Institute of American Studies, together with partner organizations.\nMore than 100 participants from both China and the U.S. discussed how to steer\nChina-U.S. relations toward a more stable and promising future.\n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2720568/1.html)\n\n\"We commemorate victory not to perpetuate hatred, but to safeguard peace; we\nremember history not to return to the past, but to move forward together,\" Sha\nsaid.\n\n\"The true value of the Flying Tigers spirit lies in its ability to transcend\ndifferences in culture, systems and ideology, and demonstrate the trust and\nsolidarity that people can muster when facing shared challenges,\" Eric Zheng,\nAdvisor to the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation and President of the\nAmerican Chamber (AmCham) of Commerce in Shanghai, said at the conference.\n\n\"I firmly believe that cooperation between the American and Chinese business\ncommunities is a continuation of the Flying Tigers spirit in times of peace,\"\nhe said.\n\nNo matter how the world changes, China-U.S. relations remain one of the most\nimportant bilateral relationships, Huang Ping, Vice President of the\nChina-U.S. People's Friendship Association and former Chinese Consul General\nin New York City, said.\n\nThe differences between the two countries should not negate their shared\ninternational responsibilities, nor should they hinder bilateral cooperation\nacross various fields, he added, stressing that there is no justification for\nboth sides to create conflicts, amplify differences or provoke confrontation.\n\nThe only right choice for them is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and\nwin-win cooperation, Huang noted.\n\nThis past June 23 was also the 100th birth anniversary of Chinese-born\nAmerican war correspondent Anna Chennault.

South\nKorea–based biotech firm LUCA AICELL has developed LUCA V-Defense Nasal\nSpray, a drug-free nasal spray designed to form a protective barrier on the\nnasal lining—offering a modern solution in the post-mask era.\n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2719487/20250527.html)\n\nA Physical Barrier, Not a Medication\n\nUnlike traditional nasal sprays that rely on steroids or antihistamines, LUCA\nV-Defense forms a non-medicated barrier across the nasal mucosa, the body's\nfirst line of defense against airborne pathogens. Instead of using steroids,\nantihistamines, or vasoconstrictors, LUCA V-Defense relies on lambda\ncarrageenan, a natural compound extracted from red algae, and antimicrobial\nlipids. These ingredients coat the nasal lining, helping to prevent viruses\nlike SARS-CoV-2 and influenza from binding to mucosal cells. Recent studies\nhave also shown that lambda carrageenan not only possesses antiviral\nproperties but also exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects,\nhelping to reduce allergic reactions in nasal tissues and inhibit histamine\nrelease, which may contribute to the prevention of allergic rhinitis.\n\nUsing LUCA's proprietary lipid nanocoating technology, the nasal spray\ndemonstrated 99.7% antiviral efficacy within one minute in an in vitro\nthird-party COVID-19 lab study overseas. This suggests potential across a\nbroad spectrum of respiratory viruses.\n\nRapid Adoption and International Certifications\n\nLUCA AICELL reports that sales of LUCA V-Defense more than tripled in the most\nrecent quarter, signaling increasing consumer interest in preventive nasal\nsprays. This demand is especially strong among parents and travelers, given\nthat no vaccine currently exists for Mycoplasma pneumonia, a common threat to\nchildren.\n\nLUCA V-Defense is classified as a medical device, not a pharmaceutical. It\nholds:\n\n * FDA listed in the United States\n * CE certified in Europe\n * MFDS approved in South Korea\nThese credentials validate its safety for daily use and its alignment with\ninternational regulatory standards.\n\nSafer than Steroid and Decongestant Sprays\n\nMany popular nasal congestion sprays contain steroids or vasoconstrictors like\nmethazoline, which can offer fast symptom relief but are linked to rebound\ncongestion, mucosal thinning, and reduced efficacy with long-term use.\n\nLUCA V-Defense addresses these issues with a plant-based, non-pharmaceutical\nformulation that's free from steroids, antihistamines, and methazoline. It is\ngentle enough for children, pregnant women, and individuals who suffer from\nseasonal allergies or chronic rhinitis. Its ease of use, a simple mist inside\neach nostril, makes it ideal for travel, commutes, or high-exposure\nenvironments like offices, schools, or public transit.\n\nRedefining Preventive Wellness in the Post-Mask Era\n\nAs the world transitions away from masks and into a new phase of pandemic\nmanagement, personal preventive tools like LUCA V-Defense are gaining\nrelevance. Whether navigating crowded airports, allergy season, or cold and\nflu outbreaks, this daily-use nasal spray offers a chemical-free alternative\nfor respiratory defense.\n\n\"The pandemic changed how we think about personal protection,\" said a LUCA\nAICELL spokesperson. \"LUCA V-Defense was developed not just for short-term\nresponse, but for long-term respiratory wellness. We see it as a smart,\nscience-backed addition to modern health routines.\"\n\n \n\nView original content to download\nmultimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/drug-free-nasal-spray-luca-v-defense-creates-a-protective-shield-against-viruses-and-allergies-302493093.html\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/drug-free-nasal-spray-luca-v-defense-creates-a-protective-shield-against-viruses-and-allergies-302493093.html)\n\nSOURCE LUCA AICELL\n\n\n\nKevin NAM, manager@amapress.co.kr\n\nPhoto: \nhttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2719487/20250527.jpg\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

GF Securities (Hong Kong) has\nlaunched the first daily-interest-accruing, daily-redeemable tokenized\nsecurities, named \"GF Token\", a building block to enable switching between\ndifferent tokenized securities. This product also features its first-ever\nmulti-channel distribution and token custody model for on-chain securities,\nnow available to both High-Net-Worth-Individual and institutional professional\ninvestors (PIs). This project is executed with active participation from\nmultiple business units under HashKey Group. This milestone signifies a major\nstep forward in the city's real world asset (RWA) tokenization journey and\nlays the groundwork for broader on-chain collaboration of tokenized securities\nby Hong Kong securities industry in the future.\n\n(https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598630/HashKey_Group_Logo.html)\n\n\"GF Token\" is a class of tokenized securities issued by GF Securities (Hong\nKong) backed by its credit support. GF Securities (Hong Kong) launches three\nproducts in different currencies: USD, HKD, and offshore RMB. Among these, the\nUSD version is benchmarked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR),\ndesigned to serve as a fair, transparent, and low-volatility cash management\ninstrument. \"GF Token\" features high liquidity, accrues interest daily, and is\nfully recorded on-chain via HashKey Chain, enabling transparent and traceable\ntransaction flows. This aims to make \"GF Token\" a building block for tokenized\nfinancial assets, by providing a seamless on-chain net settlement mechanism\nthat enables investors to switch between different tokenized securities.\n\nCompared to GF Securities (Hong Kong)'s earlier tokenized securities, \"GF\nToken\" features multi-channel distribution and token custody. Investors can\nsubscribe through GF Securities (Hong Kong) or HashKey Exchange, and hold\ntokenized securities either via traditional securities accounts or directly on\nchain, allowing traditional investors to participate broadly across all\naspects of tokenized securities in familiar settings. In addition to\ninstitutional professional investors, \"GF Token\"  in this product launch is\nalso made available to HNWI PIs, aiming to promote tokenized securities and\nrelated services to broader audience.\n\nWith the daily interest accrual mechanism, the product meets both\ninstitutional investors' needs for short-term idle capital management, and\nWeb3 users' expectations for native on-chain assets. As a forward-looking,\ncompliant financial product, \"GF Token\" demonstrates the potential of\ncombining real-world assets with blockchain infrastructure, offering a\nreplicable and scalable model for RWA scenarios.\n\nNotably, while HashKey Chain serves as the core issuance network, multiple\nbusiness units under HashKey Group were also deeply involved in the on-chain\nlaunch of \"GF Token\":\n\n * NexaToken, a service by HashKey Cloud, enabled the asset's tokenization.\n * HashKey Tokenisation contributed to GF's tokenization initiative by offering\ntechnical consultation and feasibility assessments.\n * HashKey Exchange facilitated professional investor distribution through its\nnetwork.\nThis arrangement represents a pioneering end-to-end model encompassing asset\nissuance, token custody, and multi-point distribution, establishing a robust\nfoundation for future security dealer-led tokenized asset issuance and\non-chain cooperation.\n\nMr. Zeng Chao, CEO of GF Securities (Hong Kong), commented:\n\n\"The launching of GF Token is a major milestone for GF Securities (Hong\nKong)'s digital product strategy, and an important extension of our\nchain-based product innovation. We value our partnership with HashKey Group\nand HashKey Chain. Their comprehensive infrastructure and exchange\ncapabilities enable GF's products to enter the public blockchain world more\nefficiently. Over the years, we, at GF Securities (Hong Kong), have been\ncommitted to financial innovation, leveraging fintech to expand our footprints\nin digital finance. The collaboration with HashKey Group to launch GF Token is\na key initiative in building Hong Kong's tokenized securities ecosystem. We\nbelieve this step will further solidify GF Securities (Hong Kong)'s\nfirst-mover advantage in emerging digital finance.\"\n\nIn January 2024, GF Securities (Hong Kong) became the first Chinese securities\nfirm to issue tokenized securities under Hong Kong law, minting, issuing, and\ndistributing financial assets on a public chain. This was also the first\ntokenized security issued following the SFC's circulars regarding tokenized\nsecurities published in November, 2023. Since then, the firm has introduced\ntokenized securities linked to equities and other financial assets. In January\n2025, it partnered with Cinda Asset Management to launch the first tokenized\nnote backed by a fund, continuously expanding the ecosystem of tokenized\nsecurities.\n\nDr. Xiao Feng, Chairman of HashKey Group, said:\n\n\"Bringing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain requires deep integration between\nfinancial institutions and blockchain technology providers. The launch of 'GF\nToken' perfectly reflects this synergy. As the preferred chain for financial\nassets, HashKey Chain will continue to offer trustworthy infrastructure for\ncompliant assets and help position Hong Kong as the world's most vibrant hub\nfor onchain finance.\"\n\nKay, Head of HashKey Chain, added:\n\n\"'GF Token' represents a pivotal practice in the on-chain transformation of\ntraditional financial assets. As a blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for\ncompliant assets, HashKey Chain is honored to provide GF Securities (Hong\nKong) with a stable and composable technical foundation. We believe that with\nmore leading financial institutions joining, onchain finance will gradually\nform a closed-loop ecosystem, redefining how assets are issued, traded, and\ngoverned.\"\n\nHashKey Chain will continue to deepen collaborations with traditional\nfinancial institutions such as securities firms and banks, expanding\nmechanisms for compliant on-chain asset issuance and circulation. Through the\ncombination of high-performance blockchain infrastructure and trusted assets,\nHashKey Chain is helping Hong Kong establish a real-world-ready Onchain\nFinance benchmark.\n\nAbout HashKey Chain\n\nHashKey Chain is the preferred blockchain for financial institutions and RWA\ntokenization, dedicated to promoting compliant and scalable Onchain Finance.\nAs a compliance-friendly blockchain infrastructure, HashKey Chain provides a\nsecure and transparent on-chain environment for institutions.\n\nHashKey Chain inherits Ethereum's decentralized security while enhancing\ntransaction efficiency through high-performance optimization, ensuring\non-chain asset stability and traceability.
