class=\"xn-location\">HONG KONG</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">June 27, 2025</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- HashKey Chain has officially announced that GF Securities (<span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong</span>) has become the first securities firm in <span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong</span> to issue tokenized securities by fully integrating with HashKey Chain as its core on-chain issuance network. GF Securities (<span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong</span>) has launched the first daily-interest-accruing, daily-redeemable tokenized securities, named \"GF Token\", a building block to enable switching between different tokenized securities. This product also features its first-ever multi-channel distribution and token custody model for on-chain securities, now available to both High-Net-Worth-Individual and institutional professional investors (PIs). This project is executed with active participation from multiple business units under HashKey Group. This milestone signifies a major step forward in the city's real world asset (RWA) tokenization journey and lays the groundwork for broader on-chain collaboration of tokenized securities by <span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong</span> securities industry in the future.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\">\n                <p>\n                        <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598630/HashKey_Group_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\n                    <img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/HashKey Group)\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598630/HashKey_Group_Logo.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/HashKey Group)\"/>\n                        </a>\n                </p>\n\n    </div>\n<p>\"GF Token\" is a class of tokenized securities issued by GF Securities (<span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong</span>) backed by its credit support.
