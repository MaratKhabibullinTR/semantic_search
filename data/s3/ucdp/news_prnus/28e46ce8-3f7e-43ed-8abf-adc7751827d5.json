<i>Pearson School Report: Learning for life</i> asked almost 11,000 school teachers and college tutors to share their views on student readiness at each year of primary, at the end of Year 11, and on 16–18 year-olds taking their next steps at the end of their college course.</p>\n<p>On average, primary and secondary teachers felt that at least one in three students* (32% and 31% respectively) will not be ready. At college level, tutors said the same for at least 43% of 16–18-year-olds. The top three factors teachers and tutors identified as impacting readiness were:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\"><li>Primary – Special Educational Needs and/or Disabilities (79%), struggles with writing (75%) and independence (73%)</li><li>Secondary – self-motivation (77%), independence (65%) and social maturity (62%)</li><li>College – digital wellbeing (30%), critical thinking (30%), and struggles with writing (28%)</li></ul><p>Also adding their perspectives to the annual report's biggest-ever dataset were 3,000 UK students across primary, secondary and college settings. Despite demonstrating a clear enjoyment of learning, nearly 1 in 5 school students (17%) and 1 in 4 of college students (26%) are concerned about being ready for the next stage of learning.</p>\n<p>To support improved learning and outcomes, those surveyed offered practical ideas and solutions. Their suggestions highlight a clear desire for more flexible, student-centred approaches, that include:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Stronger connections to everyday life.</b> One in three school students would integrate lessons about things in everyday life. 40% said managing money and budgeting skills are currently missing from their education, alongside speaking confidently in front of others (33%), support with how to get a job and workplace/interview skills (29%), as well as communication skills (26%).<br/> </li><li><b>Enhanced focus on practical skills.</b> Over a third of secondary students (37%) want to be taught creative skills (35% of teachers agree), 30% of secondary students and 16% of teachers want a greater focus on digital skills.<br/> </li><li><b>Adapting to AI advances. </b>44% of secondary teachers and 31% of primary teachers say they don't think students are being well prepared for an AI-driven world. This is echoed by secondary and college students with more than 1 in 4 believing they should learn about AI at school/college to improve skills. However, only 9% of teachers currently feel confident teaching students how to use AI, with calls for greater training for both existing and trainee teachers.<br/> </li><li><b>Clearer links between learning and career paths.</b> Only 8% of teachers feel the education system prepares students for future careers.

At college level,\ntutors said the same for at least 43% of 16–18-year-olds. The top three\nfactors teachers and tutors identified as impacting readiness were:\n\n * Primary – Special Educational Needs and/or Disabilities (79%), struggles\nwith writing (75%) and independence (73%)\n * Secondary – self-motivation (77%), independence (65%) and social maturity\n(62%)\n * College – digital wellbeing (30%), critical thinking (30%), and struggles\nwith writing (28%)\nAlso adding their perspectives to the annual report's biggest-ever dataset\nwere 3,000 UK students across primary, secondary and college settings. Despite\ndemonstrating a clear enjoyment of learning, nearly 1 in 5 school students\n(17%) and 1 in 4 of college students (26%) are concerned about being ready for\nthe next stage of learning.\n\nTo support improved learning and outcomes, those surveyed offered practical\nideas and solutions. Their suggestions highlight a clear desire for more\nflexible, student-centred approaches, that include:\n\n * Stronger connections to everyday life. One in three school students would\nintegrate lessons about things in everyday life. 40% said managing money and\nbudgeting skills are currently missing from their education, alongside\nspeaking confidently in front of others (33%), support with how to get a job\nand workplace/interview skills (29%), as well as communication skills (26%).\n \n * Enhanced focus on practical skills. Over a third of secondary students (37%)\nwant to be taught creative skills (35% of teachers agree), 30% of secondary\nstudents and 16% of teachers want a greater focus on digital skills.\n \n * Adapting to AI advances. 44% of secondary teachers and 31% of primary teachers\nsay they don't think students are being well prepared for an AI-driven world.\nThis is echoed by secondary and college students with more than 1 in 4\nbelieving they should learn about AI at school/college to improve skills.\nHowever, only 9% of teachers currently feel confident teaching students how to\nuse AI, with calls for greater training for both existing and trainee\nteachers.\n \n * Clearer links between learning and career paths. Only 8% of teachers feel the\neducation system prepares students for future careers. Students share this\nconcern. 15% of primary students are worried about getting a job in the\nfuture, doubling to 31% at secondary and 37% at college.\n \n * Prioritising student outcomes: Self-confidence and awareness (54%), a love of\nlearning (50%), life skills (40%) and an understanding of the wider world\n(40%) feature highly in teachers priority outcomes for students. Across the\nphases, problem solving, critical thinking, resilience and confidence are\nconsistent qualities that teachers, tutors and home educators think students\nshould develop outside of academic ability.\n \n * A reduction in curriculum volume and less emphasis on final exams: A fifth of\ncollege students (20%) say the volume of curriculum and assessment impacts\ntheir learning. 58% of school teachers would also like to see this addressed.\nReducing the focus on final exams was also key with 34% of school teachers\nsaying modular assessments would improve outcomes, while 58% of college tutors\nsaid the same for more flexible options like 'banking' credit over time.
